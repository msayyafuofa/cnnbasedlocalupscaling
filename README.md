# cnnbasedlocalupscaling
A convolutional neural network architacture for permeability upscaling

I designed and coded this network for a research paper. 

The code is written in Python and requires the following packages: tensorflow, scipy, numpy and matplotlib.

The code is a single file. 

In addition to the code, an example, created based on Strebelle’s 250×250 fluvial channel training image is included, is included. For further information, please see the following paper.
